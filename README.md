We can we this program for multiple funtions:

- increase/decrease volume and brightness
- check weather of any city
- open calender and clock
- take a screenshot
- open file explorer
- open google and youtube
- open apps of our workflow/workspace
- and dark mode

## workflow apps
This are the apps that we always open when doing work, for example a graphic designer might have workflow apps like canva, figma, sketchbook, chrome and spotify(cuz why not).
So the workflow function of macOsoft lets the user select all the apps in their workflow and open them all with a single click
